### REGEX Practice from the RegexOne class (www.regexone.com)

##In this document, the code won't run yet, but we're going to copy over the test strings from the regex101 lesson and the solutions that work.

#Lesson 1: An Introduction, and the ABCs (Letters)

Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from text such as code, log files, spreadsheets, or even documents. And while there is a lot of theory behind formal languages, the following lessons and examples will explore the more practical uses of regular expressions so that you can use them as quickly as possible.

The first thing to recognize when using regular expressions is that everything is essentially a character, and we are writing patterns to match a specific sequence of characters (also known as a string). Most patterns use normal ASCII, which includes letters, digits, punctuation and other symbols on your keyboard like %#$@!, but unicode characters can also be used to match any type of international text.

Below are a couple lines of text, notice how the text changes to highlight the matching characters on each line as you type in the input field below. To continue to the next lesson, you will need to use the new syntax and concept introduced in each lesson to write a pattern that matches all the lines provided.

Go ahead and try writing a pattern that matches all three rows, it may be as simple as the common letters on each line.

Row 1: abcdefg
Row 2: abcde
Row 3: abc
```{r}
abc
```

abc is the pattern that makes all three of these rows work because they match completely and in order with no additional characters

#Lesson 1.5: The 123s (Numbers)

Characters include normal letters, but digits as well. In fact, numbers 0-9 are also just characters and if you look at an ASCII table, they are listed sequentially.

Over the various lessons, you will be introduced to a number of special metacharacters used in regular expressions that can be used to match a specific type of character. In this case, the character \d can be used in place of any digit from 0 to 9. The preceding slash distinguishes it from the simple d character and indicates that it is a metacharacter.

Below are a few more lines of text containing digits. Try writing a pattern that matches all the digits in the strings below, and notice how your pattern matches anywhere within the string, not just starting at the first character. We will learn how to control this in a later lesson.

Row 1: abc123xyz
Row 2: define "123"
Row 3: var g = 123;
```{r}
123
```

123 is the pattern that makes all three of these rows work because they match completely and in order with no additional characters (just like abc in the first example)

#Lesson 2: The Dot (period)

In some card games, the Joker is a wildcard and can represent any card in the deck. With regular expressions, you are often matching pieces of text that you don't know the exact contents of, other than the fact that they share a common pattern or structure (eg. phone numbers or zip codes).

Similarly, there is the concept of a wildcard, which is represented by the . (dot) metacharacter, and can match any single character (letter, digit, whitespace, everything). You may notice that this actually overrides the matching of the period character, so in order to specifically match a period, you need to escape the dot by using a slash \. accordingly.

Below are a couple strings with varying characters but the same length. Try to write a single pattern that can match the first three strings, but not the last (to be skipped). You may find that you will have to escape the dot metacharacter to match the period in some of the lines.

Row 1: cat.
Row 2: 896.
Row 3: ?=+.
Row 4: abc1

```{r}
\.
```

Because the period is the only common character in the first three lines, we need to match the period, but because the period(.) acts as wildcard, we need to use a forward slash with it to tell Regex that we want to match on that singular character

#Lesson 3: Matching Specific Characters 

The dot metacharacter from the last lesson is pretty powerful, but sometimes too powerful. If we are matching phone numbers for example, we don't want to validate the letters "(abc) def-ghij" as being a valid number!

There is a method for matching specific characters using regular expressions, by defining them inside square brackets. For example, the pattern [abc] will only match a single a, b, or c letter and nothing else.

Below are a couple lines, where we only want to match the first three strings, but not the last three strings. Notice how we can't avoid matching the last three strings if we use the dot, but have to specifically define what letters to match using the notation above.

Match: can
Match: man
Match: fan
Skip: dan
Skip: ran
Skip: pan

```{r}
[cmf]an# - this will help you match the exact words - probably the best answer here
[cmf]..# - this will find any three letter string that begins with c, m, or f
[cmf]# - this will find any string that begins with c, m, or f. probably not strict enough
```

#Lesson 4: Excluding Specific Characters 

In some cases, we might know that there are specific characters that we don't want to match too, for example, we might only want to match phone numbers that are not from the area code 650.

To represent this, we use a similar expression that excludes specific characters using the square brackets and the ^ (hat). For example, the pattern [^abc] will match any single character except for the letters a, b, or c.

With the strings below, try writing a pattern that matches only the live animals (hog, dog, but not bog). Notice how most patterns of this type can also be written using the technique from the last lesson as they are really two sides of the same coin. By having both choices, you can decide which one is easier to write and understand when composing your own patterns.

Match: hog
Match: dog
Skip: bog

```{r}
[^b]og
```

[^b]og is the pattern that makes all three of these rows work because the bracketed/carroted b excludes it from the first letter position, while specifying "og" as the last 3 makes sure to capture any 3 character string ending in OG

#Lesson 5: Character Ranges

We just learned how to create a pattern that matches or excludes specific characters -- but what if we want to match a character that can be in a sequential range characters? Do we have no choice but to list them all out?

Luckily, when using the square bracket notation, there is a shorthand for matching a character in list of sequential characters by using the dash to indicate a character range. For example, the pattern [0-6] will only match any single digit character from zero to six, and nothing else. And likewise, [^n-p] will only match any single character except for letters n to p.

Multiple character ranges can also be used in the same set of brackets, along with individual characters. An example of this is the alphanumeric \w metacharacter which is equivalent to the character range [A-Za-z0-9_] and often used to match characters in English text.

In the exercise below, notice how all the match and skip lines have a pattern, and use the bracket notation to match or skip each character from each line. Be aware that patterns are case sensitive and a-z differs from A-Z in terms of the characters it matches (lower vs upper case).

Match: Ana
Match: hog
Match: dog
Skip: bog
Skip: bby
Skip: ccz
```{r}
[A-C][n-p][a-c]
```

All the letters are sequential here, so you can use the ranges as shown above to match just the first three lines

#Lesson 6: Catching some zzz's

Note: Some parts of the repetition syntax below isn't supported in all regular expression implementations.

We've so far learned how to specify the range of characters we want to match, but how about the number of repetitions of characters that we want to match? One way that we can do this is to explicitly spell out exactly how many characters we want, eg. \d\d\d which would match exactly three digits.

A more convenient way is to specify how many repetitions of each character we want using the curly braces notation. For example, a{3} will match the a character exactly three times. Certain regular expression engines will even allow you to specify a range for this repetition such that a{1,3} will match the a character no more than 3 times, but no less than once for example.

This quantifier can be used with any character, or special metacharacters, for example w{3} (three w's), [wxy]{5} (five characters, each of which can be a w, x, or y) and .{2,6} (between two and six of any character).

In the lines below, the last string with only one z isn't what we would consider a proper spelling of the slang "wazzup?". Try writing a pattern that matches only the first two spellings by using the curly brace notation above.

Match: wazzzzzup
Match: wazzzup
Skip: wazzup

```{r}
waz{3.5}up #this will most precisely answer the problem above, however other combinations work that with less specificity
waz{3,99}up # this will capture everything with up to 
waz{3.5} #this works, but won't require the string to be ended with "up"
z{3} or zzz #probably the least specific way to get there, a
```

#Lesson 7: Mr. Kleene, Mr. Kleene

A powerful concept in regular expressions is the ability to match an arbitrary number of characters. For example, imagine that you wrote a form that has a donation field that takes a numerical value in dollars. A wealthy user may drop by and want to donate $25,000, while a normal user may want to donate $25.

One way to express such a pattern would be to use what is known as the Kleene Star and the Kleene Plus, which essentially represents either 0 or more or 1 or more of the character that it follows (it always follows a character or group). For example, to match the donations above, we can use the pattern \d* to match any number of digits, but a tighter regular expression would be \d+ which ensures that the input string has at least one digit.

These quantifiers can be used with any character or special metacharacters, for example a+ (one or more a's), [abc]+ (one or more of any a, b, or c character) and .* (zero or more of any character).

Below are a few simple strings that you can match using both the star and plus metacharacters.

Match: aaaabcc
Match: aabbbbc
Skip: aacc
Skip: a

```{r}
aa+ #is the simplest solution, because the options have an even number of "aa" we can say to repeat aa any number of times. but probably not restrictive enough
aa+b*c #this uses the sam
a{2,4}b{0,4}c{1,2} #most restrictive, what this spells out is: between 2 and 4 a's, between 0 and 4 b's, and between 1 and 2 c's
```

#Lesson 8: Characters Optional

As you saw in the previous lesson, the Kleene star and plus allow us to match repeated characters in a line.

Another quantifier that is really common when matching and extracting text is the ? (question mark) metacharacter which denotes optionality. This metacharacter allows you to match either zero or one of the preceding character or group. For example, the pattern ab?c will match either the strings "abc" or "ac" because the b is considered optional.

Similar to the dot metacharacter, the question mark is a special character and you will have to escape it using a slash \? to match a plain question mark character in a string.

In the strings below, notice how the the plurality of the word "file" depends on the number of files found. Try writing a pattern that uses the optionality metacharacter to match only the lines where one or more files were found.

Match: 1 file found?
Match: 2 files found?
Match: 24 files found?
Skip: No files found.

```{r}
[0-9]+ files? found\? #my first answer. It gets the job done precisely. Theres probably another way to get any number to work
\d+ files? found\? #recommended answer. I think the \d+ accomplishes the same as [0-9]+ because we're telling it that it can pick any repetition of digits. 
```

#Lesson : All this whitespace

When dealing with real-world input, such as log files and even user input, it's difficult not to encounter whitespace. We use it to format pieces of information to make it easier to read and scan visually, and a single space can put a wrench into the simplest regular expression.

The most common forms of whitespace you will use with regular expressions are the space (␣), the tab (\t), the new line (\n) and the carriage return (\r) (useful in Windows environments), and these special characters match each of their respective whitespaces. In addition, a whitespace special character \s will match any of the specific whitespaces above and #is extremely useful when dealing with raw input text#.

In the strings below, you'll find that the content of each line is indented by some whitespace from the index of the line (the number is a part of the text to match). Try writing a pattern that can match each line containing whitespace characters between the number and the content. Notice that the whitespace characters are just like any other character and the special metacharacters like the star and the plus can be used as well.

Match: 1. abc
Match: 2.       abc
Match: 3.           abc

```{r}
[1-9]+\.\s+abc #my initial answer
\d\.\s+ abc# the provided answer. I think this is the same again
```

#Lesson 10: Starting and Ending

So far, we've been writing regular expressions that partially match pieces across all the text. Sometimes this isn't desirable, imagine for example we wanted to match the word "success" in a log file. We certainly don't want that pattern to match a line that says "Error: unsuccessful operation"! That is why it is often best practice to write as specific regular expressions as possible to ensure that we don't get false positives when matching against real world text.

One way to tighten our patterns is to define a pattern that describes both the start and the end of the line using the special ^ (hat) and $ (dollar sign) metacharacters. In the example above, we can use the pattern ^success to match only a line that begins with the word "success", but not the line "Error: unsuccessful operation". And if you combine both the hat and the dollar sign, you create a pattern that matches the whole line completely at the beginning and end.

Note that this is different than the hat used inside a set of bracket [^...] for excluding characters, which can be confusing when reading regular expressions.

Try to match each of the strings below using these new special characters.

Match: Mission: Successful
Skip: Last Mission: unsuccessful
Skip: Next Mission: successful upon capture of target

```{r}
^Mission: successful$ #this is the right answer, although just ^M would have allowed us to move on here
   # The expression 'Mission: successful' will match anywhere in the text, so we need to use the starting and ending anchors in an expression ^Mission: successful$ to only match the full string that starts with 'Mission' and ends with 'successful'.
```

#Lesson 11: Match Groups

Regular expressions allow us to not just match text but also to extract information for further processing. This is done by defining groups of characters and capturing them using the special parentheses ( and ) metacharacters. Any subpattern inside a pair of parentheses will be captured as a group. In practice, this can be used to extract information like phone numbers or emails from all sorts of data.

Imagine for example that you had a command line tool to list all the image files you have in the cloud. You could then use a pattern such as ^(IMG\d+\.png)$ to capture and extract the full filename, but if you only wanted to capture the filename without the extension, you could use the pattern ^(IMG\d+)\.png$ which only captures the part before the period.

Go ahead and try to use this to write a regular expression that matches only the filenames (not including extension) of the PDF files below.

Capture: file_record_transcript.pdf
Capture: file_07241999.pdf
Skip: testfile_fake.pdf.tmp
```{r}
^(file.+)\.pdf$
```

#Lesson 12: Nested Groups

When you are working with complex data, you can easily find yourself having to extract multiple layers of information, which can result in nested groups. Generally, the results of the captured groups are in the order in which they are defined (in order by open parenthesis).

Take the example from the previous lesson, of capturing the filenames of all the image files you have in a list. If each of these image files had a sequential picture number in the filename, you could extract both the filename and the picture number using the same pattern by writing an expression like ^(IMG(\d+))\.png$ (using a nested parenthesis to capture the digits).

The nested groups are read from left to right in the pattern, with the first capture group being the contents of the first parentheses group, etc.

For the following strings, write an expression that matches and captures both the full date, as well as the year of the date.

Capture: Jan 1987 & 1987
Capture: May 1969 & 1969
Capture: Aug 2011 & 2011

```{r}
(\w+ (\d+)) #this breaks down to any string of letters (\w+) followed by a space, and then any string of numbers (\d+) in additional parentheses
```

#Lesson 13: More group work

As you saw in the previous lessons, all the quantifiers including the star *, plus +, repetition {m,n} and the question mark ? can all be used within the capture group patterns. This is the only way to apply quantifiers on sequences of characters instead of the individual characters themselves.

For example, if I knew that a phone number may or may not contain an area code, the right pattern would test for the existence of the whole group of digits (\d{3})? and not the individual characters themselves (which would be wrong).

Depending on the regular expression engine you are using, you can also use non-capturing groups which will allow you to match the group but not have it show up in the results.

Below are a couple different common display resolutions, try to capture the width and height of each display.

Capture: 1280x720 -> 1280 & 720
Capture: 1920x1600 -> 1920 & 1600
Capture: 1024x768 -> 1024 & 768

```{r}
(\d+)x(\d+) #pretty simple this time 
```

#Lesson 14: It's all conditional

As we mentioned before, it's always good to be precise, and that applies to coding, talking, and even regular expressions. For example, you wouldn't write a grocery list for someone to Buy more .* because you would have no idea what you could get back. Instead you would write Buy more milk or Buy more bread, and in regular expressions, we can actually define these conditionals explicitly.

Specifically when using groups, you can use the | (logical OR, aka. the pipe) to denote different possible sets of characters. In the above example, I can write the pattern "Buy more (milk|bread|juice)" to match only the strings Buy more milk, Buy more bread, or Buy more juice.

Like normal groups, you can use any sequence of characters or metacharacters in a condition, for example, ([cb]ats*|[dh]ogs?) would match either cats or bats, or, dogs or hogs. Writing patterns with many conditions can be hard to read, so you should consider making them separate patterns if they get too complex.

Go ahead and try writing a conditional pattern that matches only the lines with small fuzzy creatures below.

Match: I love cats
Match: I love dogs
Skip: I love logs
Skip: I love cogs

```{r}
I love (cats|dogs) # the | in the middle of cats dogs works as an "or" statement
```
